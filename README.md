# seatsio-js, the official Seats.io JS library
This is the official JavaScript client library for the [Seats.io V2 REST API](https://docs.seats.io/docs/api-overview).

> **Read This First!**
> 
> This library is intended mainly for **serverside (Node)** use. 
>
> `seatsio-js` requires your seats.io secret key. This key carries many privileges, including creating events, booking and releasing seats, and more. If you use this lib in a browser, you are exposing your secret key to your user.   
> So, while `seatsio-js` technically works in clientside code too, it's almost never a good idea to do so. 
>
> **Only use this in browser code if you know what you're doing (e.g. if you're building a password-protected backoffice application for admins)**. You have been warned :) 

![Build](https://github.com/seatsio/seatsio-js/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

## Installing
For Node, you can install using npm:

```sh
npm install seatsio
```
Then you can use it with require: 
```js
const { SeatsioClient } = require('seatsio')
```
For browser, you can directly include it from GitHub:

```html
<script src="https://github.com/seatsio/seatsio-js/releases/download/<RELEASE_TAG>/SeatsioClient.js"></script>
```

This library uses `async/await` introduced with ES2017 and `for await` loops which is part of the ES2018. `for await` loops gained native support from Node 10 onwards. As a result, the minimum required version for Node is 10. 

## Versioning

seatsio-js follows semver since v54.4.0.

Please note that any version below v2 is not production ready.

## Examples

### Creating a chart and an event
Once you create a new `SeatsioClient` using your _secret key_, you can create _charts_ and then _events_. You can find your _secret key_ in the Settings section of your workspace: https://app.seats.io/workspace-settings. It is important that you keep your _secret key_ private and not expose it in-browser calls unless it is password protected.

```js
let client = new SeatsioClient(Region.EU(), <WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>)
let chart = await client.charts.create()
let event = await client.events.create(chart.key)
console.log(`Created a chart with key ${chart.key} and an event with key: ${event.key}`)
```

### Booking objects

Booking an object changes its status to `booked`. Booked seats are not selectable on a rendered chart.

[https://docs.seats.io/docs/api-book-objects](https://docs.seats.io/docs/api-book-objects).

```js
let client = new SeatsioClient(Region.EU(), <WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>)
await client.events.book(<AN EVENT KEY>, ['A-1', 'A-2'])
```

### Booking objects that are on `HOLD`

```js
let client = new SeatsioClient(Region.EU(), <WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>)
await client.events.book(<AN EVENT KEY>, ["A-1", "A-2"], <A HOLD TOKEN>)
```

### Booking general admission (GA) areas

Either

```js
let client = new SeatsioClient(Region.EU(), <WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>)
await client.events.book(<AN EVENT KEY>, ["GA1", "GA1", "GA1"])
```

Or:

```js
let client = new SeatsioClient(Region.EU(), <WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>)
await client.events.book(<AN EVENT KEY>, {"objectId": "GA1", "quantity" : 3})
```

### Releasing objects

Releasing objects changes its status to `free`. Free seats are selectable on a rendered chart.

[https://docs.seats.io/docs/api-release-objects](https://docs.seats.io/docs/api-release-objects).

```js
let client = new SeatsioClient(Region.EU(), <WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>)
await client.events.release(<AN EVENT KEY>, ["A-1", "A-2"])
```

### Changing object status

Changes the object status to a custom status of your choice. If you need more statuses than just booked and free, you can use this to change the status of a seat, table or booth to your own custom status.

[https://docs.seats.io/docs/api-custom-object-status](https://docs.seats.io/docs/api-custom-object-status)

```js
let client = new SeatsioClient(Region.EU(), <WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>)
await client.events.changeObjectStatus(<AN EVENT KEY>, ["A-1", "A-2"], "unavailable")
```
### Listing status changes

`statusChanges` method returns a `Lister`. You can use `statusChanges().all()`, which returns an AsyncIterator, in a `for await` loop to iterate over all status changes.

```js
for await (let statusChange of client.events.statusChanges(<AN EVENT KEY>).all()) {
    //Do something with the status change
}
```

You can alternatively use the paginated methods to retrieve status changes. To list status changes that comes after or before a given status change, you can use `statusChanges().pageAfter()` and `statusChanges().pageBefore()` methods.

```js
await client.events.statusChanges(<AN EVENT KEY>).firstPage(<OPTIONAL parameters>, <OPTIONAL pageSize>)
await client.events.statusChanges(<AN EVENT KEY>).pageAfter(<A STATUS CHANGE ID>, <OPTIONAL parameters>, <OPTIONAL pageSize>) 
await client.events.statusChanges(<AN EVENT KEY>).pageBefore(<A STATUS CHANGE ID>, <OPTIONAL parameters>, <OPTIONAL pageSize>) 
```  

You can also pass an optional parameter to _filter_, _sort_ or _order_ status changes. For this parameter, you can you use the helper class called `StatusChangesParams`.  

```js
const {StatusChangesParams} = require('seatsio')
let parameter = new StatusChangesParams().withFilter('testFilter')
let parameter = new StatusChangesParams().sortByObjectLabel()
let parameter = new StatusChangesParams().sortByDate()
let parameter = new StatusChangesParams().sortByStatus()
let parameter = new StatusChangesParams().sortDescending()
let parameter = new StatusChangesParams().sortAscending()
```
A combination of filter, sorting order and sorting option is also possible. 

```js
let parameter = new StatusChangesParams().withFilter('testFilter').sortByStatus().sortAscending()
```

### Event reports

Want to know which seats of an event are booked, and which ones are free? Thatâ€™s where reporting comes in handy.

The report types you can choose from are:
- byStatus
- byCategoryLabel
- byCategoryKey
- byLabel
- byOrderId

[https://docs.seats.io/docs/api-event-reports](https://docs.seats.io/docs/api-event-reports)

```js
let client = new SeatsioClient(Region.EU(), <WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>)
await client.eventReports.byStatus(<AN EVENT KEY>, <OPTIONAL FILTER>)
```

### Listing all charts

You can list all charts using `listAll()` method which returns an asynchronous iterator `AsyncIterator`. You can use `for await` loop to retrieve all charts.

```js
let client = new SeatsioClient(Region.EU(), <WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>)

for await(let chart of client.charts.listAll()){
    console.log(`Chart key: ${chart.key}`)
}
```

### Listing charts page by page

E.g. to show charts in a paginated list on a dashboard.

Each page contains an `items` array of charts, and `nextPageStartsAfter` and `previousPageEndsBefore` properties. Those properties are the chart IDs after which the next page starts or the previous page ends.

```js
// ... user initially opens the screen ...

let firstPage = client.charts.listFirstPage();
firstPage.items.forEach(chart => console.log(`Chart key: ${chart.key}`));
```

```js
// ... user clicks on 'next page' button ...

let nextPage = client.charts.listPageAfter(firstPage.nextPageStartsAfter);
nextPage.items.forEach(chart => console.log(`Chart key: ${chart.key}`));
```

```js
// ... user clicks on 'previous page' button ...

let previousPage = client.charts.listPageBefore(nextPage.previousPageEndsBefore);
previousPage.items.forEach(chart => console.log(`Chart key: ${chart.key}`));
```

### Creating a workspace

```js
let client = new SeatsioClient(Region.EU(), <COMPANY ADMIN KEY>)
await client.workspaces.create('a workspace');
```

## Error Handling
When an API call results in an error, a rejected promise is returned with the response received from the server. This response contains a message string describing what went wrong, and also two other properties:

- `messages`: an array of error messages that the server returned. In most cases, this array will contain only one element.
- `requestId`: the identifier of the request you made. Please mention this to us when you have questions, as it will make debugging easier.

## Rate limiting - exponential backoff

This library supports [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff).

When you send too many concurrent requests, the server returns an error `429 - Too Many Requests`. We react to this by waiting for a while, and then retrying the request.
If the request still fails with an error `429`, we wait a little longer, and try again. This happens at most 5 times, before we give up (after approximately 15 seconds).
